## General Patch Notes Info

https://hitruns-wiki.vercel.app/docs/h3_patch_notes#list-of-patches

## OS
- This should work on Windows as well as Linux using Wine / Steam Proton (there is no native Linux version for Hitman 3)
- As a bit of trivia, most Legendary users are on Linux, presumably with Wine for Epic

## General Command Line Stuff
- Just know the very basics
- Right click folder in Windows Explorer > Copy address as text
- cd `<ADDRESS>`
- Right click to paste into terminal

## Install Instructions
### Epic
- Open the official Epic Games Launcher, click profile picture in upper right, then go to Settings > Manage Games > Uncheck "Allow Auto Updates". Otherwise, the game will update itself to the latest version automatically again if you ever open the Epic Games launcher later for any reason.
- `legendary auth`
- `legendary install Eider --manifest <MANIFEST_FILE_PATH>`
  - If you get asked if you want to install offline or if you want to install DLC's, say yes.
  - You might get 403 errors on the download; the Epic / Legendary servers aren't very stable for downloading. Either wait it out,
  or hit `Ctrl C` to cancel the download and try again.
- `legendary verify Eider`
- `legendary repair Eider`
  - The two commands above of verify and repair are needed because often times, at least a few downloaded files will be corrupted. Your game will not launch if files are corrupted, so you should verify and repair always after installing the downpatch files.
- `legendary launch Eider --skip-version-check`
  - The `--skip-version-check` argument is needed on a downpatched game, or it won't launch.

### Steam
- Right click Hitman 3 in your Steam Library > Properties > Updates > Only update this game when I launch it
- You may need the latest version of dotnet, especially if you use an older version of Visual Studio for programming.
  - Install here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
- `ddotnet DepotDownloader.dll -app 1847520 -depot 1659041 -manifest <MANIFEST_ID> -user <STEAM_USER_ID> -pass <STEAM_PASSWORD> -dir <INSTALLDIR>`
- `dotnet DepotDownloader.dll -app 1847520 -depot 1659041 -manifest <MANIFEST_ID> -user <STEAM_USER_ID> -pass <STEAM_PASSWORD> -dir <INSTALLDIR> -validate`
- Alternatively, if you want to keep your downpatch files separate / maintain a backup, you can leave out the `dir <INSTALLDIR` argument and copy over the files manually.

## Miscellaneous
- Thank you Notex for sharing the Legendary manifest files (Legendary manifests are only generated if you played the game on that patch, so you would have to have played the game on every patch on Legendary since launch to have them all otherwise).
- "Downpatching" Hitman 3 with the following methods is not true downpatching like you will see in other games.
  - The game server will remain the current version, which can cause some strange interactions (more on this later).
  - Technically you can use an older game version along with an older version of Peacock, but this would mainly just help you avoid some visual bugs. Also some older versions of Peacock are not archived publicly.
  - Generally speaking the current game server is fine for our purposes.
- You wouldn't think it, but you can connect to the current server version on downpatched version of Hitman 3, even up to launch patch (January 2021). This currently is true with both official servers latest version as well as Peacock latest version.
- Some items or missions from later patches are available on earlier patches. Here are some general guidelines regarding compatibility (non-exhaustive list, do not take as universal truths)
  - A suit / item with messed up name but with a thumbnail (insert screenshot later) will work if equipped.
    - In general, a missing thumbnail indicates that an item is unusable on that patch. If you equip it, it will not show up in inventory after you are loaded in (for item), or you will not be wearing it (for suit).
  - A mission (main mission, contract, escalation, etc) will work even if the thumbnail is gone and name is messed up. 
    - However, a mission that says "Get Access" will not work
  - In general, some items are internally introduced to the game's servers before they officially become available in a patch. In a downpatched game state, you can access some items earlier than you should be able to (with fully working thumbnails and normal item name). 
    - For instance, Molotov can be accessed in the downpatch state as far back as January 2022 (with non-glitched UI / thumbnail), although it was only introduced to the game officially in July 2022.
    - Because of this, while the official game patch notes / roadmaps are a good guideline for when an item would be available, it is not 100% correct.
  - In general, you can unlock items on an older patch. As long as the mission / item involved are playable (following guidelines above), it should work. Even if the item has messed up name and the challenge name UI is also messed up, it will unlock. When you return to current patch, you will retain that unlock you completed on old patch.
  - You will not lose progress, mastery, or challenge completion by downpatching, in general. 
    - Exception: Some items / missions will unplayable, or simply not there on older patches. In this case, your new patch unlocks won't carry over. See guidelines above.
- Both Steam Depot Downloader and Legendary require you to own the game on Steam or Epic respectively to download the required files. 
  - Note that the free Steam Demo of Hitman 3 lets you download all the patch files, although you may not be able to do much with them, as explained below.
- The manifest files provided / linked require you to own the game on Steam / Epic to play the game with. Piracy is not condoned.
- In general, any edition of Hitman 3 actually has you install all the game files, buying DLC just unlocks access. No matter what DLC you own, downpatching will similarly give you all game files. But you might not be able to play all of it if you don't own access to them.
- The downpatched files from Steam and Epic are mostly but not completely compatible with each other. Any files ending with `.exe` are cross-platform. However, the `Launcher.exe` and `Hitman3.exe` will only work on the platform they are designed for.
  - Due to an inability to get earlier versions of the `.exe` files from Steam Depot Downloader, Steam Hitman 3 is probably locked onto versions of January 2022 or later.
